# Contributing Guidelines
Thanks for choosing to contribute to Discord Bot Creator.

## Requirements
There are multiple sections in the project that require different knowledge.

### Template Files
To edit template files, which will be copied to a user-chosen folder later an understanding of discord.js@13 is needed.
You will need to look into the different classes from ``templates/empty/utils`` to understand what the separate files in ``templates/empty/actions`` are doing.

### Renderer
The renderer folder contains all Next.js components and frontend logic.
To contribute here you'd have to know Next.js or React and a little bit about electron.

### Main
The main folder contains all Electron logic.
It's important that the code here works in production and works on Windows, Linux and MacOS

## Guidelines
We are working on the project together, and it's important that we all have fun doing it.
By contributing you vote for open source software and for a better, more efficient way of creating bots.
Anything that is against the Discord TOS and the GitHub TOS is bad and is not tolerated.

Please make sure that your code is readable and efficient.
